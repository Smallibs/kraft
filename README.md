# kraft

A Kotlin multiplatform Raft consensus implementation base on:
- immutability in order to be functional friendly,
- an agnostic network layer,
- an event based approach suitable for an implementation with actors and
- an agnostic database layer i.e. based on abstract command execution.

##  Node Kind

The NodeKind denotes the behaviors linked to a node. We have:
- an Elector i.e. a Follower without a Leader in the Raft specification
- a Candidate
- a Follower and
- a Leader.

Each oriented arrow is defined by:
- a message, 
- a condition if necessary and 
- a set of reactions to be performed by the system.
 
For instance, when an Elector accepts a RequestVote message it becomes a Follower, and
an AcceptVote reaction should be performed. This reaction highlights the acceptance to
be send to the corresponding Candidate. This AcceptVote is managed by a Candidate node.

## Work in progress ...

Things to be done:
- a proof of this implementation
- a client `insert` method conforming to the specification
- the log compaction
- use IO monads for database evolution for instance
- ...
